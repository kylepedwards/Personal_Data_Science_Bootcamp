    "# **<ins>Module 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing - Turning Raw Data into Usable Insights</ins>**\n",
    "* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing is the second critical stage in the data science workflow.\n",
    "* Raw data is often messy, inconsistent, and filled with errors, missing values, or duplicate entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **<ins>What is Data Cleaning and Preprocessing?</ins>**\n",
    "* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing involve identifying, correcting, and preparing raw data to make it usable for analysis and modeling.\n",
    "    * This process ensures that the data is accurate, consistent, and complete, removing any biases or errors that might mislead analysis or affect the performance of machine learning models.\n",
    "* Real-world data is rarely perfect - it may have missing values, outliers, duplicates, incorrect formats, or inconsistencies. Cleaning and preprocessing aims to handle these problems systematically.\n",
